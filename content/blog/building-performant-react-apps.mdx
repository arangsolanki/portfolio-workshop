# Building Performant React Applications in 2026

React continues to evolve, and with it, the best practices for building performant applications. In this article, we'll explore the latest techniques and patterns that will help you build blazing-fast React apps.

## Server Components

React Server Components are now a cornerstone of modern React development. They allow you to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle sent to the client.

```tsx
// This component runs only on the server
async function BlogPost({ slug }: { slug: string }) {
  const post = await getPost(slug);
  return <article>{post.content}</article>;
}
```

## Code Splitting

Proper code splitting ensures users only download the code they need:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <Skeleton />,
});
```

## Conclusion

By combining these techniques, you can build React applications that are both feature-rich and performant. The key is to always measure and optimize based on real user data.
